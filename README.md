This is still very much a VIP, that I'll probably finish just before we have another LAN party =D
Basically the idea is to be able to directly link anything from youtube into a playlist anyone can listen on the LAN.
This fixes issues with Spotify's limited catalog and Discord's compressed audio quality + horrbile user experience with the bots.
